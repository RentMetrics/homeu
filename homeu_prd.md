## 6. Design & UX Considerations

*   **UI (Renter):** Clean, modern, intuitive, trustworthy. Clear display of itemized rent charges.
*   **UX (Renter):** Seamless navigation. Crypto payment flow needs extreme clarity. Verification process transparent.
*   **UI/UX (Admin Portal):** Functional, secure, and efficient for admin tasks. Clear data presentation. Role-based access controls.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness:** Essential for renter-facing app. Admin portal primarily desktop.
*   **Accessibility:** Adhere to WCAG guidelines for renter app.
*   **Security Visuals:** Clearly indicate secure areas.

## 7. Technical Considerations

*   **Platform:** Web Application (Renter-facing and Admin Portal).
*   **Frontend:** (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) – Potentially two separate front-ends or a single app with role-based views.
*   **Backend:** (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django/Flask)
*   **Database:** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) – Needs robust schema for PMC, property, unit, resident, lease, ledger, and payment data.
*   **APIs & Integrations:**
    *   Payment Gateway (Stripe, Braintree, Plaid).
    *   Cryptocurrency Payment Processor.
    *   Credit Score Provider.
    *   Tenant Screening Service API.
    *   **Property Management Software (PMS) APIs:**
        *   Crucial for fetching rent ledger/breakdown and resident data.
        *   Examples: AppFolio, Buildium, Yardi, RealPage (each has different API capabilities and integration complexities). This is a major undertaking.
    *   Notification Service.
*   **Security:**
    *   (As before, plus):
    *   Secure admin portal access (MFA highly recommended).
    *   Role-based access control (RBAC) within the admin portal.
    *   Strict separation of duties and data access.
*   **Deployment:** (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
*   **Scalability:** Design for growth in users, properties, and PMCs.

## 8. Success Metrics

*   (As before, plus):
*   Number of Property Management Companies onboarded/integrated.
*   Accuracy of rent ledger data displayed.
*   Efficiency of admin operations in linking residents/properties.

## 9. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

*   (As before, plus):
*   **Dedicated Property Manager Portal:** Allowing PMCs to self-manage properties, view payments, communicate with residents, etc.
*   Automated resident onboarding via PMS data sync.
*   Broader and deeper PMS integrations.

## 10. Open Questions/Risks

*   (As before, plus):
*   **PMS Integration Complexity:** Which PMS systems to target first? API availability, cost, and variability are major challenges. This could be the biggest hurdle.
*   How to handle discrepancies if PMS data conflicts with user expectations?
*   Security and data integrity of the admin portal and PMC payment information.
*   Scalability of managing numerous PMC integrations and their unique requirements.
*   Process for verifying and onboarding PMCs securely.
*   Initial data load: How will existing resident/lease data be populated for properties that come onboard?

```

**Key Changes and Implications:**

*   **Increased Complexity for MVP:**
    *   **Rent Breakdown:** If dependent on PMS integration, this makes MVP significantly harder. A simpler MVP might have the user enter their total rent amount, with itemized breakdown via PMS as a fast-follow or V2 feature. However, the PRD now reflects the *ideal*.
    *   **Admin Portal:** A basic version of this is almost certainly needed for MVP if HomeU aims to be the payment intermediary between residents and specific, onboarded property management companies. It's how you'll ensure money goes to the right place reliably.
*   **Property Management Software (PMS) Integration:** This is now a central and critical technical consideration. It's a challenging area due to the fragmented market and varying API quality/availability of PMS vendors. This will require significant research and development effort.
*   **Data Modeling:** Your database will need to be more sophisticated to handle the relationships between PMCs, properties, units, leases, residents, and ledgers.

These additions make HomeU a much more powerful and potentially sticky platform, but also increase the initial build effort and operational overhead. Prioritization will be key.
